# Clinical Trial Sponsor Portal

**Version**: 1.0
**Status**: Active
**Last Updated**: 2026-01-18

---

## What Is This Application?

The Sponsor Portal is a web-based application that enables clinical trial staff to manage clinical studies. It provides tools for linking patients to the mobile app, managing questionnaires, and monitoring trial activities.

**Important**: The Sponsor Portal is an **optional** component. It is only necessary when sponsors require a web interface for clinical trial staff to manage patients and monitor trial activities.

**Platform**: Web application only. Accessible via desktop and laptop browsers. Mobile browser access is not currently supported.

---

## Who Uses This Application?

The portal supports three generic role templates that sponsors map to their organization-specific roles (see REQ-p70008):

### Investigator

Investigators manage day-to-day patient operations at their assigned clinical sites. They:

- Link patients to the mobile app
- Send questionnaires (EQ, Nose HHT, Quality of Life)
- Approve completed questionnaires during patient visits
- Monitor patient linking status
- View their own audit logs

### Auditor

Auditors provide monitoring and oversight across multiple sites. They:

- View Investigator activities at assigned sites
- Review audit logs for compliance verification
- Monitor patient linking metrics
- Prepare for monitoring visits

### Admin

Admins manage system configuration and user accounts. They:

- Create, edit, deactivate, and reactivate user accounts
- Assign users to roles and sites
- Unlock locked user accounts
- View sites (read-only)
- View their own administrative audit logs

**Note**: These are generic role templates. Each sponsor maps these to their own role names (e.g., "Study Coordinator" for Investigator, "CRA" for Auditor) and customizes capabilities to match their organizational requirements.

## How Do Multiple Sponsors Use The Same System?

**Isolated Portal Instances**: Each pharmaceutical company or research organization gets their own completely separate portal instance with its own database.

**How It Works**:

1. **Separate Deployments**: Each sponsor has their own portal URL (e.g., `sponsor-alpha.portal.example.com`)
2. **Isolated Databases**: Each sponsor's data is stored in a completely separate database
3. **Custom Branding**: Each portal displays that sponsor's logo and colors
4. **No Data Sharing**: Sponsors cannot see each other's data - complete isolation
5. We only use codenames for Sponsors in the public repository.
6. A new private repository using a code name is created for each Sponsor to store their configuration and branding

**Example**:

- ACME has `europa.portal.example.com` with their own database and branding
- PharmaStartup has `ganymede.portal.example.com` with their own database and branding
- The two portals are completely independent and isolated from each other

## Definitions

**Linking** (or **Patient Linking**): The process of connecting a patient's mobile app to their records in the sponsor portal, enabling bidirectional data synchronization. Linking is distinct from **study enrollment**, which is the sponsor's regulatory process for admitting patients into a clinical trial and is managed entirely outside this system.

**Mobile Linking Code**: A unique, time-limited, single-use code generated by clinical staff and provided to the patient. The patient enters this code in the mobile app to complete linking.

**Mobile Linking Status**: The current state of the connection between a patient's mobile app and the sponsor portal. Core statuses: **Not Connected** → **Pending** → **Connected**. Sponsors may configure additional statuses to match their study protocol.

---

## Key Capabilities

### Patient Linking

Investigators can link patients to the mobile app by generating a Mobile Linking Code. Patients enter the code in their mobile app to establish connection.

### Questionnaire Management

Investigators can:

- Send EQ questionnaire immediately after patient linking (enables diary data sync)
- Send Nose HHT and Quality of Life questionnaires before patient visits
- Approve questionnaires during in-person patient visits
- Track questionnaire completion status

### Patient Monitoring

Investigators and Auditors can:

- Track Mobile Linking Status
- Receive inactivity alerts
- View patient linking metrics

### Audit Trail

All user actions are logged for regulatory compliance:

- Patient linking and disconnection
- Questionnaire sends and approvals
- User account changes
- Site assignment changes

### Multi-Site Support

- Investigators can be assigned to multiple sites
- Auditors can monitor multiple sites
- Admins have access to all sites by default

### Multi-Role Support

- Users can be assigned multiple roles
- Users can switch between roles without logging out

### Authentication and Security

- Password reset and account activation with mandatory email-based 2FA
- Account lockout after failed login attempts
- Session management with inactivity timeout

# REQ-p70008: Sponsor-Specific Role Mapping

**Level**: PRD | **Status**: Draft | **Implements**: p70001, p70005

## Rationale

Clinical trial sponsors have established organizational structures with existing role definitions (e.g., "Study Coordinator", "Clinical Research Associate", "Site Administrator"). While the platform provides generic role templates (Investigator, Auditor, Admin), each sponsor needs to map these to their specific role names and customize capabilities to match their organizational requirements and SOPs. This mapping ensures the platform adapts to sponsor workflows rather than forcing sponsors to adopt new terminology and processes.

## Assertions

A. The system SHALL support mapping between platform generic roles and sponsor-specific role names.

B. The system SHALL support mapping between platform generic roles and sponsor-specific role capabilities.

C. Each sponsor SHALL be able to define custom role names that map to generic role templates.

D. The system SHALL maintain a role mapping configuration that translates sponsor-specific roles to platform permissions and access levels.

E. The platform SHALL define generic role templates (Investigator, Auditor, Admin) with baseline capabilities.

F. Users SHALL see sponsor-specific role names in the UI.

G. Users SHALL NOT see generic platform role names in the UI.

H. Role mapping changes SHALL be logged in the audit trail.

# REQ-p70009: Link New Patient Workflow

**Level**: PRD | **Status**: Draft | **Implements**: p00011, p00004

## Rationale

Patient linking establishes a secure connection between the patient's mobile device and the sponsor portal, enabling questionnaire distribution and diary data collection. Unique codes prevent unauthorized access. Clinical staff controls when linking occurs, ensuring the patient is ready to begin trial participation.

**Note on Mobile Linking Statuses**: The core Mobile Linking Status workflow is: **Not Connected** → **Pending** → **Connected**. Sponsors may define additional statuses (e.g., "Screening", "Active", "On Hold") based on their study protocol. The assertions below describe core status transitions; sponsor-specific statuses are configured per sponsor deployment.

## Assertions

A. The system SHALL allow clinical staff to link patients to the mobile app by generating Mobile Linking Codes per REQ-p70007 (Linking Code Lifecycle Management).

B. The patient SHALL enter the Mobile Linking Code in the mobile app to complete linking.

C. The Mobile Linking Status SHALL change to "Pending" when code is generated.

D. The Mobile Linking Status SHALL change to "Connected" when patient successfully enters code.

E. The system SHALL reject invalid or expired codes.

F. The linking action SHALL be logged in the audit trail with timestamp and username.

G. The system SHALL support sponsor configuration of additional Mobile Linking Statuses beyond the core workflow.

# REQ-p70010: Patient Disconnection Workflow

**Level**: PRD | **Status**: Draft | **Implements**: p00011, p00004

## Rationale

Patients may lose their phone, upgrade devices, or experience technical issues requiring disconnection. Disconnection invalidates the Mobile Linking Code to prevent unauthorized access from lost/stolen devices while preserving all patient data for reconnection. This is a temporary state allowing patients to resume participation after receiving a replacement device or resolving technical issues.

**Note on Mobile Linking Statuses**: The core status transitions for disconnection are part of the overall workflow: **Connected** → **Disconnected**. Sponsors may define additional or alternative statuses based on their study protocol. The assertions below describe core disconnection behavior; sponsor-specific status names and transitions are configured per sponsor deployment.

## Assertions

A. The system SHALL allow clinical staff to disconnect patients from the mobile app.

B. The "Disconnect Patient" option SHALL be available in the patient actions menu for "Connected" patients.

C. The system SHALL display a confirmation dialog with patient ID and require reason selection.

D. The patient status SHALL change to "Disconnected" upon confirmation.

E. The Mobile Linking Code SHALL be invalidated immediately upon disconnection.

F. The patient mobile app SHALL stop syncing data after disconnection.

G. The mobile app SHALL display a prominent error message if its Mobile Linking Code is no longer valid.

H. Mobile App operation and local storage of data SHALL NOT change due to an expired or revoked Mobile Linking Code.

I. The disconnection SHALL be logged in the audit trail with reason, timestamp, and username.

J. The "Reconnect Patient" option SHALL become available after disconnection.

K. The system SHALL support sponsor configuration of additional disconnection-related statuses or reasons.

# REQ-p70011: Patient Reconnection Workflow

**Level**: PRD | **Status**: Draft | **Implements**: p00011, p00004

## Rationale

Patients who were disconnected due to lost phone, device upgrade, or technical issues need the ability to reconnect and resume trial participation. A new Mobile Linking Code ensures security (the old code cannot be reused) while enabling legitimate reconnection. Requiring a reason documents why reconnection occurred for audit purposes. Clinical staff controls reconnection timing and provides the code directly to the patient.

**Note on Mobile Linking Statuses**: Reconnection restores the patient to "Connected" status as part of the core workflow. Sponsors may define additional intermediate statuses for the reconnection process based on their study protocol. The assertions below describe core reconnection behavior; sponsor-specific status names and transitions are configured per sponsor deployment.

## Assertions

A. The system SHALL allow clinical staff to reconnect patients with "Disconnected" status by generating a new Mobile Linking Code.

B. The "Reconnect Patient" action SHALL only be available for patients with "Disconnected" status.

C. The confirmation dialog SHALL display the patient ID and require a reason.

D. The system SHALL generate a new Mobile Linking Code upon confirmation.

E. The previous Mobile Linking Code SHALL remain invalidated and cannot be reused.

F. The patient SHALL enter the new Mobile Linking Code in the mobile app to restore access.

G. The Mobile Linking Status SHALL change to "Connected" after successful code entry.

H. The patient SHALL be able to resume data sync and questionnaire completion.

I. The reconnection SHALL be logged in the audit trail with reason, timestamp, and username.

J. The reconnected Mobile App SHALL sync data to the portal that was collected during the disconnected period.

K. The system SHALL support sponsor configuration of additional reconnection-related statuses.
