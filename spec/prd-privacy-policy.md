## Executive Summary

Privacy regulations such as GDPR and HIPAA mandate transparent disclosure of data collection practices and user rights. Clinical trial regulations including FDA 21 CFR Part 11, ICH-GCP E6(R2), and EU Clinical Trial Regulation 536/2014 impose additional protections for research participant data. This requirement defines the multi-layered privacy documentation approach (general policies, diary-specific addenda, clinical trial templates, sponsor-specific supplements) that accommodates different user types and regulatory contexts while maintaining a consistent baseline of privacy protection.

# REQ-p01020: Privacy Policy and Regulatory Compliance Documentation

**Level**: PRD | **Status**: Draft | **Implements**: p00010

## Rationale

Privacy regulations such as GDPR and HIPAA mandate transparent disclosure of data collection practices and user rights, while clinical trial regulations including FDA 21 CFR Part 11, ICH-GCP E6(R2), and EU Clinical Trial Regulation 536/2014 impose additional protections for research participant data. Comprehensive privacy documentation serves multiple purposes: ensuring legal compliance across jurisdictions, building user trust through transparency, protecting patient rights with clear explanations of legal protections, and supporting regulatory submissions for clinical trials. The multi-layered documentation approach (general policies, diary-specific addenda, clinical trial templates, sponsor-specific supplements) accommodates different user types and regulatory contexts while maintaining a consistent baseline of privacy protection. Version control and annual reviews ensure documentation remains current with evolving regulations and platform capabilities.
