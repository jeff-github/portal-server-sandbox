# DS001: ':latest' tag used in FROM statements
# Justification: Our Dockerfiles use ':latest' in ARG defaults for local development.
# The CI/CD workflows override these with specific GHCR references (e.g., ghcr.io/cure-hht/clinical-diary-base:latest).
# This is intentional and safe because:
# 1. Local development benefits from ':latest' for convenience
# 2. CI/CD always provides explicit registry paths
# 3. Production builds are tagged with commit SHAs for reproducibility
# Files affected: dev.Dockerfile, ops.Dockerfile, mgmt.Dockerfile, qa.Dockerfile
