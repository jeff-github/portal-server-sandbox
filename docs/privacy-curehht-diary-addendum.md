# TABLE OF CONTENTS

# 1. PROJECT OVERVIEW

## 1.1 Application Description

The Cure HHT Nosebleed Diary (Diary or Application) is a mobile
and web-based health diary designed to help individuals with Hereditary
Hemorrhagic Telangiectasia (HHT) track epistaxis (nosebleed) events and
related health information. The Diary serves multiple purposes:

-   **Personal Health Management:** Enabling users to maintain accurate
    records of their epistaxis events for personal reference and sharing
    with healthcare providers

-   **Research Contribution:** Supporting the Cure HHT Foundations
    research mission by allowing users to voluntarily contribute
    de-identified data for HHT research

-   **Clinical Trial Support:** Serving as an electronic diary for
    participants in pharmaceutical clinical trials studying HHT
    treatments

# 4. DATA SHARING

## 4.1 Cure HHT Foundation (Opt-In)

**We do not automatically share your data with Cure HHT Foundation.** If
you choose to contribute your data to support HHT research and patient
services, you may opt in through the Diarys consent settings. Upon
opting in, your data may be used for:

-   Research database contribution (de-identified)

-   Program development and patient support services

-   Aggregate reporting on the HHT patient community

**You may opt out at any time,** which will stop future data sharing
while preserving data already contributed to de-identified research
databases.

**Important:** Under GDPR, you own your basic health data and may choose
to share it with Cure HHT Foundation independently of any clinical trial
participation.

## 4.2 Clinical Trial Sponsors and Partners (Opt-In)

**Clinical trial data sharing occurs only when you voluntarily enroll in
a clinical trial and provide informed consent.** If you choose to
participate in a clinical trial conducted through the Cure HHT
Foundation, data may be shared with:

-   **Pharmaceutical Sponsors:** Trial-specific data as specified in
    your informed consent

-   **Contract Research Organizations (CROs):** For trial management and
    monitoring

-   **Clinical Investigators:** Site-specific participant data

-   **Data Safety Monitoring Boards:** For safety oversight

-   **Regulatory Authorities (FDA, EMA):** As required for drug approval

You will receive a separate, detailed informed consent document from the 
Clinical trial Sponsor that explains exactly what data will be shared and with whom. 

**Note on Third-Party Trial Participation:** If you participate in other
clinical trials or research studies unrelated to the HHT Diary,
you may optionally indicate this participation (as a yes/no indicator
only) to enable proper analysis of your Cure HHT data. No information
about the identity of the sponsor, trial, or any other details will be
collected or shared.

## 4.3 Healthcare Providers

At your direction, you may export or share your data with your
healthcare providers.

## 4.4 Service Providers

We use the following categories of service providers, all bound by
appropriate agreements:

# 5. CLINICAL TRIAL PROVISIONS

**IMPORTANT:** This section applies only when you consent to participate
in a clinical trial. Clinical trial requirements may override certain
standard privacy provisions as permitted by law.

## 5.1 Regulatory Override

When you consent to participate in a clinical trial governed by FDA 21
CFR Part 11, EU Clinical Trial Regulation 536/2014, or ICH-GCP
guidelines, the following regulatory requirements take precedence:

-   **Data Integrity:** Clinical trial data cannot be deleted or
    substantially modified to preserve scientific integrity

-   **Audit Trails:** All data entries and modifications are permanently
    logged with timestamps and user attribution

-   **Extended Retention:** Clinical trial data must be retained for
    regulatory-mandated periods (see Section 6)

-   **Regulatory Access:** Regulatory authorities may inspect clinical
    trial records

## 5.2 Patient-Reported Data Authority

Consistent with international consensus standards for HHT clinical
trials:

-   **Patient-reported data remains authoritative** -- Your original
    diary entries are the primary record

-   **Investigator annotations are separate** -- Any investigator
    corrections or queries are stored as metadata, not modifications to
    your original entries

-   **Data provenance is maintained** -- The origin and history of all
    data is fully traceable

## 5.3 Modified Diary Functionality During Trial Participation

During active clinical trial participation, certain Diary functions
may be limited, altered, added or disabled per the trial's protocol to ensure
integrity of the data and regulatory compliance.


## 5.4 Modified Rights During Trial Participation

During active clinical trial participation, certain rights may be
limited:

-   **Right to Erasure:** May be suspended for trial data integrity; you
    may withdraw from the trial, but existing data must be retained

-   **Right to Rectification:** Original entries cannot be overwritten;
    corrections are recorded as annotations

-   **Right to Restriction:** Limited for data required by trial
    protocol

These limitations apply only to clinical trial data and only during the
trial period plus required retention. Your non-trial personal health
data remains subject to full privacy rights.

## 5.5 Electronic Signatures

For clinical trial data requiring electronic signatures (21 CFR Part
11):

-   Signatures are legally binding and equivalent to handwritten
    signatures

-   Each signature is linked to your unique credentials

-   Signature events are permanently logged

-   You must not share your credentials with anyone
