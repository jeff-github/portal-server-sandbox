# STUDY OVERVIEW

## Purpose

The Cure HHT Foundation invites you to participate in a natural history
study of Hereditary Hemorrhagic Telangiectasia (HHT). This study aims to
better understand the patterns and progression of HHT symptoms,
particularly epistaxis (nosebleeds), to improve treatment and care for
individuals with HHT.

## What is HHT?

Hereditary Hemorrhagic Telangiectasia (HHT) is a genetic disorder causing
abnormal blood vessel formation, which leads to frequent nosebleeds,
telangiectasias (small abnormal blood vessels), and potential organ
involvement.

## Your Participation

By participating in this natural history study, you will use the Cure HHT
Nosebleed Diary mobile application to track your nosebleeds and related
health information. Your data will help researchers better understand HHT
and develop improved treatments.

---

# WHAT WILL HAPPEN IF YOU PARTICIPATE

## 1. Using the Nosebleed Diary

You will download and use the Cure HHT Nosebleed Diary mobile application
to record:

-   **Nosebleed Events:** Date, time, duration, severity, location, and
    interventions used

-   **No-Bleed Days:** Confirmation of days without nosebleeds

-   **Optional Information:** Related bleeding events, medications,
    activities, and quality of life observations

## 2. Data Collection

The data you enter will be stored securely and may be used for:

-   **Natural History Research:** Understanding patterns and progression
    of HHT symptoms over time

-   **Longitudinal Studies:** Long-term tracking of epistaxis frequency
    and severity

-   **Treatment Guidelines:** Developing evidence-based recommendations
    for HHT care

-   **Scientific Publications:** Contributing to peer-reviewed research
    about HHT

## 3. Assessments

You may be asked to complete periodic questionnaires, including:

-   **Epistaxis Severity Score (ESS):** A standardized assessment of
    nosebleed impact (calculated from your diary entries)

-   **NOSE-HHT:** Nasal Outcome Score for Epistaxis in HHT questionnaire

-   **Quality of Life (QoL-HHT):** Assessment of how HHT affects your
    daily life

-   **Other HHT-Specific Assessments:** As determined by the research
    protocol

## 4. Time Commitment

-   **Daily:** Record nosebleed events as they occur (typically 1-5
    minutes per entry)

-   **Weekly/Monthly:** Optional questionnaires (5-15 minutes)

-   **Ongoing:** Continue participation as long as you wish -- there is
    no fixed end date for this natural history study

# DATA USE AND SHARING

## How Your Data Will Be Used

### De-Identified Research Data

Your diary data will be de-identified (name, email, and other identifying
information removed) and included in the Cure HHT Foundation research
database. This de-identified data may be used for:

-   Statistical analysis of HHT symptom patterns

-   Comparison across different patient populations

-   Development of clinical guidelines and recommendations

-   Sharing with qualified researchers studying HHT

### Aggregate Statistics

Aggregate, non-identifiable statistics (e.g., "Average nosebleed
frequency across 500 participants") may be:

-   Published in scientific journals

-   Presented at medical conferences

-   Shared with healthcare providers to improve HHT care

-   Used in Cure HHT Foundation reports and communications

### What Data Will NOT Be Shared

-   Your name, email address, or other personally identifying information

-   Individual patient-level data that could identify you

-   Your data will never be sold to third parties

## Who Will Have Access

### Cure HHT Foundation

-   Research staff analyzing HHT natural history data

-   Healthcare providers developing treatment guidelines (de-identified
    data only)

### Qualified Researchers

The Cure HHT Foundation may share de-identified data with qualified
researchers who:

-   Have submitted an approved research proposal

-   Have signed data use agreements protecting patient privacy

-   Are conducting ethical research to advance HHT understanding and
    treatment

### Not Included in This Study

This natural history study is **separate from pharmaceutical clinical
trials**. If you choose to participate in a pharmaceutical clinical trial
in the future:

-   You will receive a separate informed consent for that trial

-   That trial will have its own data sharing provisions

-   Your participation in this natural history study does not obligate
    you to join any clinical trial

# RISKS AND BENEFITS

## Risks

**Minimal Risk:** This is an observational study with minimal risk. You
are simply recording information about your existing health condition.

**Possible Risks:**

-   **Time and Effort:** Recording diary entries requires time and
    attention

-   **Privacy Risk:** Although data is de-identified and protected, there
    is a small risk of data breach (we use industry-standard encryption
    and security measures to minimize this risk)

-   **Emotional Discomfort:** Tracking nosebleeds may increase awareness
    of your symptoms, which some individuals find distressing

## Benefits

**Direct Benefits:**

-   **Personal Health Tracking:** Maintain accurate records of your
    nosebleeds to share with your healthcare providers

-   **Pattern Recognition:** Identify triggers or patterns in your
    nosebleeds

-   **Symptom Management:** Better understand and manage your HHT
    symptoms

**Indirect Benefits:**

-   **Advancing HHT Research:** Contribute to scientific understanding of
    HHT

-   **Improving Care:** Help develop better treatment guidelines for the
    HHT community

-   **Supporting Others:** Your data may help future HHT patients receive
    better care
