# Diagram(s) Instructions

## Instructions: Editing .drawio Files
Follow these steps to modify your Google Cloud architecture diagrams using the diagrams.net (formerly draw.io) web interface.

### 1. Uploading the File
Navigate to the Web App: Open https://app.diagrams.net/ in your browser.

Select Storage Location: Choose where you would like to save your progress (e.g., GitHub, Google Drive, or Device for local storage).

Open your File:

Drag & Drop: Drag the .drawio file from your local folder directly onto the canvas.

Menu Option: Go to File > Open From... and select the source of your file.

### 2. Editing the Content
Once the diagram is loaded, you can utilize the following interface areas:

Shape Library (Left Panel): Search for "Google Cloud" to find official GCP icons. Drag them onto the canvas to add new resources.

Canvas (Center): * Move/Resize: Click and drag objects. Use the blue corner handles for scaling.

Connect: Hover over a shape until green connection points appear, then drag a line to another object.

Edit Text: Double-click any shape or line to update labels (e.g., changing IP ranges or project IDs).

Format Panel (Right Panel): * Use the Style tab to change colors (e.g., setting the VPC boundary color).

Use the Arrange tab to group objects or bring specific layers to the front.

### 3. Saving and Exporting
Auto-Save: If you are linked to GitHub or a Cloud provider, changes are usually saved automatically.

Manual Export: To save a local copy, go to File > Export As and select XML (.drawio) to keep the file editable, or PNG/PDF for documentation viewing.

GitHub Sync: If you opened the file via the GitHub integration, use File > Save to commit the changes directly to your repository.
