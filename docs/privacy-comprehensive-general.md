**Anspar Foundation**

**Version 1.0**

Last Updated: November 27, 2025

**MODULAR POLICY STRUCTURE**

*This Comprehensive General Privacy Policy (Policy) establishes the
foundational privacy framework for all Anspar Foundation activities.
Project-specific privacy requirements are addressed in separate Project
Privacy Addenda that supplement---but do not replace---this Policy.*

# 1. INTRODUCTION

## 1.1 About Anspar Foundation

Anspar Foundation (Anspar, we, us, or our) is a
technology development organization that builds applications and systems
for healthcare, research, and charitable purposes. We work with partner
organizations, including patient advocacy foundations, research
institutions, and healthcare providers, to develop technology solutions
that advance health outcomes and scientific understanding.

## 1.2 Purpose of This Policy

This Comprehensive General Privacy Policy (Policy) describes how
Anspar Foundation collects, uses, shares, protects, and retains personal
information across all our activities, projects, and services. This
Policy applies to:

-   Our website(s) and online services

-   Applications and software we develop

-   Research projects and clinical studies we support

-   Interactions with donors, partners, and collaborators

-   Employment and contractor relationships

## 1.3 Modular Policy Structure

This Policy establishes our foundational privacy framework. Because we
engage in diverse projects with varying data collection requirements, we
use a modular structure:

**Comprehensive General Privacy Policy (This Document):** Establishes
core principles, rights, security standards, and governance that apply
to all Anspar activities.

**Concise General Privacy Policy:** A summary document containing the
essential Policy information necessary to comply with GDPR and other
regulations.

**Project Privacy Addenda:** Supplemental documents that specify
project-specific data collection, use, sharing, and retention practices.
Each addendum incorporates this Policy by reference.

When you use a specific Anspar project or service, both this Policy and
any applicable Project Privacy Addendum govern your information. In the
event of a conflict between this Policy and a Project Privacy Addendum,
the Project Privacy Addendum controls for that specific project, except
that a Project Privacy Addendum may not reduce the core protections and
rights established in Sections 6 (Your Rights), 7 (Data Security), and
14 (Complaints) of this Policy.

## 1.4 Regulatory Compliance Framework

This Policy is designed to comply with applicable privacy and data
protection laws, including:

-   **United States Federal Laws:** Health Insurance Portability and
    Accountability Act (HIPAA); Health Information Technology for
    Economic and Clinical Health (HITECH) Act; FDA regulations including
    21 CFR Part 11

-   **European Union Laws:** General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR)
    (EU) 2016/679; Clinical Trial Regulation (EU) No 536/2014; EU GMP
    Annex 11

-   **California Laws:** California Consumer Privacy Act (CCPA) as
    amended by California Privacy Rights Act (CPRA); California
    Confidentiality of Medical Information Act (CMIA)

-   **Other U.S. State Laws:** Virginia, Colorado, Connecticut, and
    other state privacy laws as applicable

Specific regulatory requirements for individual projects are detailed in
the applicable Project Privacy Addenda.

## 1.5 Transferability and Successor Organizations

Anspar Foundation frequently develops technology in partnership with or
under contract to other organizations. This Policy is designed to ensure
continuity when:

-   A project or its technology is transferred to a partner organization

-   Anspars role changes from developer to supporter, or vice versa

-   Organizational restructuring occurs

Upon any such transfer, existing consents and authorizations remain
valid, the successor organization assumes all applicable obligations,
and users are notified but are not required to provide new consent for
the transfer itself.
