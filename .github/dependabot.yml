# Notes:
# 1. Dependabot does NOT support SHA-pinning GitHub Actions
#    - For FDA compliance, consider Renovate (see Linear ticket CUR-XXX)
# 2. Dockerfile ENV versions (e.g., SUPABASE_CLI_VERSION) are NOT detected
#    - These must be updated manually (quarterly maintenance review)
# 3. Security updates are enabled automatically if vulnerability alerts are on
# 4. Align this with quarterly maintenance-check.yml reviews
