            This PR modifies workflows that use \`BOT_BYPASS_MAIN_PROTECTION\`, which allows bypassing branch protection.

            **Files using bypass token:**
            ${{ steps.check_bypass.outputs.bypass_files }}

            **Security Checklist:**
            - [ ] Workflow only modifies authorized files
            - [ ] Workflow includes pre/post validation checks
            - [ ] \`.github/workflows/validate-bot-commits.yml\` updated if needed
            - [ ] \`.github/BOT_SECURITY.md\` updated to document the new usage
            - [ ] Security team has reviewed and approved

            **⚠️ Unauthorized use of this token will be detected and blocked by the \`validate-bot-commits\` workflow.**

            See \`.github/BOT_SECURITY.md\` for security policy.
