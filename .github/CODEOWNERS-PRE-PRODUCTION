# CODEOWNERS (PRE-PRODUCTION) - Require reviews for sensitive files
#
# ⚠️ THIS FILE IS CURRENTLY INACTIVE (renamed to CODEOWNERS-PRE-PRODUCTION)
#
# To activate workflow protection:
# 1. Set repository variable: WORKFLOW_PROTECTION_ENABLED=true
# 2. Rename this file: git mv .github/CODEOWNERS-PRE-PRODUCTION .github/CODEOWNERS
# 3. Commit and merge to main
#
# When active (renamed to CODEOWNERS):
# - GitHub enforces these review requirements automatically
# - Works in conjunction with WORKFLOW_PROTECTION_ENABLED variable
# - Automated alerts (workflow) controlled by variable
# - Code review requirements (CODEOWNERS) controlled by filename

# Workflows that use bypass tokens require review
/.github/workflows/ @Cure-HHT/admins

# Security policy requires review
