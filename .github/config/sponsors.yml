# Local Sponsor Configuration
#
# This file provides a local fallback for sponsor discovery when SPONSOR_MANIFEST
# environment variable is not available (e.g., local development without Doppler).
#
# Priority order for sponsor resolution:
#   1. SPONSOR_MANIFEST env var (Doppler - production/CI)
#   2. This file (local development fallback)
#   3. sponsor/ directory scan (auto-discovery)
#
# IMPLEMENTS REQUIREMENTS:
#   REQ-d00069: Doppler manifest system
#   REQ-d00070: Sponsor integration automation

# See also: spec/dev-sponsor-repos.md for full specification
