Ultrathink time!
Our small team is making an android/iOS/web diary app. We are working in an FDA clinical trial setting. 
It is definitely NOT a medical device. 
It might even be considered DHT (digital health technology) and fall under much less scrutiny than a full-on EDC. 

Consider each of these categories as if you were an expert in them. 
Decide if each item in the category is applicable to our system and make a plan to address it, including requirements, tool choice, spec, deployment, ops and deployment approvals.

After all items have been examined, make a recommendation for implementing solutions to the identified gaps.
